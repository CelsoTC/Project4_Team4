# In this folder there are files from the best training we got so far

We have the reward vs episodes and the neural network model

Those values were obtained after 79,000 episodes and trained for around 25 million states

Other simulation will be done over the weekend to see if we can achieve a better result, however, in this new simulation I will save the best reward model and will record the highest state obtained each episode as well
