# Project 4 Team 4
Project 4 for reinforcement learning

## Environment information

The package `gym-2048` does not work with newer versions of Python. For now I have installed `python==3.6` in a new environment (I know version 3.10 does not work since it requires numpy 1.14)

## Files

- `main.py` has an example from gym-2048 on how to run the environment
